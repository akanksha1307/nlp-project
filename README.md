# Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of sentiment analysis for movie reviews. It uses natural language processing techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their content. This README provides information on setting up the project and running the sentiment analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `movie_reviews.csv` file. It contains a collection of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. Download NLTK data:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the dataset file `movie_reviews.csv` in the project directory.

2. Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script:

   ```
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

3. The script will preprocess the data, train a sentiment analysis model, and evaluate its performance. The accuracy and classification report will be displayed in the console.

## Additional Notes

- You can fine-tune the model or experiment with different preprocessing techniques by modifying the code in `sentiment_analysis.py`.

- If you want to deploy the model as a web application or integrate it into another project, further development and adaptation will be needed.
